- **TDMS File Directory** - Path to the directory used to store TDMS data files. 
    > If left blank the TDMS File Directory will be automatically populated with a path to a subfolder ("TDMS Files") within the getting started example root directory. TDMS data files include files for LLP packet acquisition, I2C timestamps, and GPIO timestamps.
- **Display Acquired Images** - Enable to display acquired images.
    > Image data is transferred from the FPGA to the host for up to two serial channels by default. Displaying more acquired images requires modifying the host and FPGA source code and recompiling the FPGA bitfile.
- **Log Packets to Disk** - Enable to log LLP packet data for each active serial channel to a TDMS file.
- **Logged Packets to Display** - Number of logged LLP packets to display per channel in the _Acquired Packets_ table when the getting started example completes. Specifying a negative number displays all logged packets.
    > Note: Specifying a large number of packets to display may cause the VI to appear unresponsive for a period of time after the acquisition completes while the packet data is processed.
- **Log I2C to Disk** - Enable to log I2C timestamps to a TDMS file.
- **Log GPIO to Disk** - Enable to log GPIO timestamps to a TDMS file.
### Serial Channel Tab
- **CSI-2 Data Source** - Selects the CSI-2 data source type. "Corrected" returns the received data after correcting for single-bit transmission errors. "Raw" returns the received data as is. 
- **Configuration Script** - Full path to a script file used to configure the deserializer.

        - **line skip count** - Number of lines to skip between displayed lines.
            > Note: For Bayer encoded images, even line skip count values are suggested to prevent skipping all pixels associated with a given color component.
        
            > Note : For YUV420 data types, the the data is encoded in line pairs in addition to pixel pairs so line skip counts are treated as line pair skip counts. For example, a skip count of 1 will keep 2 lines and then skip 2 lines, a skip count of 2 will keep 2 lines and then skip 4 lines, etc.

        - **pixel skip count** - Number of pixels to skip between displayed pixels.
            > Note: For Bayer encoded images, even pixel skip count values are suggested to prevent skipping all pixels associated with a given color component.
        
            > Note : For YUV data types, the the data is encoded in pixel pairs so pixel skip counts are treated as pixel pair skip counts. For example, a skip count of 1 will keep 2 pixels and then skip 2 pixels, a skip count of 2 will keep 2 pixels and then skip 4 pixels, etc.

    > This control may be modified while the VI is running.

- **Source Rate (fps)** - Displays the frame rate in frames per second at which the image data is being received.
- **Update Rate (fps)** - Displays the rate in frames per second at which the image display indicator is being updated.
    > Note: If multiple frames have arrived since the last update, only the most recent frame is displayed and the others are skipped in an attempt to keep up with the acquisition.
### Serial Channel Packets Tab (First or Second)
> The getting started example displays packet data for the first two channels specified in the Channel Configurations array at the completion of the acquisition. If other packet data is desired, either re-order the active channels in the configuration array on the Serial Channel tab or use the TDMS File Viewer utility.
- **Acquired Packets** - Displays the LLP packet information for the number of packets specified in the **Logged Packets to Display** control starting at the first logged packet.
    > Note: If displaying a large number of packets, the VI may appear unresponsive for a period of time after the acquisition completes while the packet data is processed.
