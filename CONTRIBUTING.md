# Style Guide
The list below gives some basic style guidelines with the intent of maintaining a consistent approach to the documentation for all contributors.

- Use present tense rather than future tense in all cases.  For example, use "is" instead of "will be" or "causes" instead of "will cause".
- Use a verb in "ing" form in the title of any section that is a process - a series of steps for the user to follow.
- Numeric steps in tutorials must have a specific action to perform. If updating multiple controls in single numeric step, al bulleted list is used.
- Informative text in a tutorial without a specific action is displayed as a blockquote.
    > \> blockquote test
- Use **bold text** for controls, indicators and enums.
    > \*\*bold text\*\*
- Use <font face = "courier new">monospace font</font> for text that is entered in a control.
    > \<font face = "courier new"\>monospace text\</font\>
- Use four spaces for all indentations.
- Include a blank line before all headings to prevent unexpected indentation in github.io.
