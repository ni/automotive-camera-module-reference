## Prerequisites
This tutorial is written for users who understand how to perform a basic generation and a basic acquisition with PXIe-148X GMSL or FPD-Link interface modules. It is recommended to complete the [PXIe-148X Getting Started Example - Basic Acquisition Tutorial](gse-acq-basic.md) and [PXIe-148X Getting Started Example - Basic Generation Tutorial](gse-gen-basic.md) before attempting this tutorial.

> Note: The tutorials in this document assume the use of a PXIe-148X GMSL or FPD-Link Generation Interface module and an Acquisition Interface module connected to SI0 and SO0 of the respective modules. A Leopard Imaging IMX490 camera is also used to acquire packet data and replay it through a generation interface module. See PXIe-148X Getting Started Example - Basic Acquisition Tutorial and Basic Generation Tutorial for specific setup if needed.

## Generation and Acquisition Topics
This tutorial expects that SO0 of a generation module and SI0 of an acquisition module are cabled together. This tutorial will use one generation LabVIEW project and one acquisition LabVIEW project to demonstrate the generation capabilities of the generation module.

> Note: For the purposes of this tutorial, all input control values not specified should be left as the default value.


### Performing a Simple Generation and Acquisition
1. Create a TDMS file for generation. There are two options for creating a TDMS file.

| Option A: Create a TDMS File | Option B: Acquire Data from a Camera |
|-|-|
| Double click the Create CSI-2 Packet TDMS Files VI in the generation LabVIEW project and create a TDMS file for SI0. Leave all values default. | Acquire data from a camera.<br />If the data was acquired from a camera attached to a serial input channel other than SI0, rename the TDMS file on disk to have SI0 in the name to generate on SI0.<br />Copy the acquired TDMS file to the default TDMS folder for generation. |

2. Double click the Generation Example VI in the LabVIEW project.

3. Set the following controls on the Generation Example GSE VI and leave all other values at their defaults.
    > Note: VI controls and indicators can be reset to default values by clicking on the **Edit** menu and selecting the **Reinitialize Values to Default** option.

    | Tab | Control | Value |

### Generating and Displaying I2C Timestamps
This tutorial shows how to acquire and view I2C timestamps on the PXIe-148X interface module. The Generation Example VI will be used to run a script to create I2C traffic.

> Note: Timestamps are relative to a time immediately after the FPGA bitfile is downloaded and run, not the start of the acquisition. This allows capturing I2C and GPIO timestamps during configuration before the acquisition starts.

1. Set the following controls on the Acquisition Example GSE VI and leave all other values at their defaults.
    > Note: VI controls and indicators can be reset to default values by clicking on the **Edit** menu and selecting the **Reinitialize Values to Default** option.

    | Resource       | Log I2C to Disk         | Enabled                                                                                                                                                             |

2.  Select the **I2C** tab and make the following modifications.

    > The I2C tab only has one control, the I2C **timestamp filter**. This filter contains an array of timestamp IDs. **User24** represents the I2C traffic on serial channel 0 (SI0), **User25** represents the I2C traffic on serial channel 1 (SI1), and so on.
    - Set the **timestamp filter** array to contain only the **User24** timestamp ID. This will let you see the I2C traffic on SI0. If you run the VI with a configuration script selected, you will see configuration traffic in the I2C Data Output tab after the VI has stopped.

4.  Select the **I2C** tab on the Generation VI and make the following modifications.

    > The I2C tab only has one control, the I2C **timestamp filter**. This filter contains an array of timestamp IDs. **User24** represents the I2C traffic on serial channel 0 (SI0), **User25** represents the I2C traffic on serial channel 1 (SI1), and so on.
    - Set the **timestamp filter** array to contain only the **User24** timestamp ID. This will let you see the I2C traffic on SI0. If you run the VI with a configuration script selected, you will see configuration traffic in the I2C Data Output tab after the VI has stopped.

    ![Configuration Settings I2C Tab](../../images/PXIe-148X-Acq-I2CTab-FiniteAcq.png)

5.  Run the Acquisition VI. 

6.  Run the Generation VI.

    > Note: Because a script was defined in the **Serializer (Output) Configuration Script** control, the generation begins immediately without pausing while illuminating **Waiting for Serializer Setup** as seen in previous sections of this tutorial.  In this scenario, the Acquisition VI must be started before the Generation VI.

7.  Select the **I2C Timestamps** tab on the Generation VI to view I2C timestamp data.
    - View the displayed I2C timestamp data in the **I2C Timestamps** table. The **I2C Timestamps** table displays I2C timestamp information for all I2C traffic. I2C timestamps begin logging immediately after the FPGA bitfile is downloaded and include timestamp data prior to the start of the LLP packet data acquisition (i.e. I2C traffic from the configuration script).

        > Note: To display I2C timestamp data, **Log I2C to Disk** must be enabled and desired timestamp IDs must be added to the **timestamp filter** array. The I2C timestamp data displayed is read from the User_Timestamps.tdms file and filtered to display only timestamp IDs included in the timestamp filer array. The **I2C Timestamps** display is updated after the acquisitions completes.
   
8. Select the **I2C Timestamps** tab on the Acquisition VI to view I2C timestamp data.

    | Resource | TDMS File Directory| A directory path to TDMS files containing LLP Packet data for serial output channels (e.g. <font face = "courier new">SI0_LLP_Packets.tdms</font>) |
    
    > Note: The **TDMS File Directory** is a folder selection and the browse dialog shows folders only, not file names. 
    >
    > Use the default **TDMS File Directory** value if generating from a TDMS file created with the Create CSI-2 Packet TDMS Files utility's default settings. See the [PXIe-148X Getting Started Example - Basic Generation Tutorial](gse-gen-basic.md#create-tdms-files-for-generation) for details on creating TDMS files.

## Setting Serial Channel Configurations

This tutorial shows you how to configure the **Serial Channel** tab to generate and display images on multiple serial output channels and set a start trigger delay.

### Creating TDMS Files to Generate Multiple Images

1. Open the Create CSI-2 Packet TDMS Files utility in the LabVIEW project.

2. Run the VI with all default settings to generate a TDMS file for channel SI0 containing 10 frames at 1920x1080 resolution.

3. Make the following modifications on the Create CSI-2 Packet TDMS Files utility front panel to generate a second TDMS file with image data differing from the first TDMS file created in the previous step.
    - Set the value at index 0 of the **Serial Input Channels** array to <font face = "courier new">SI1</font>.
    - Make the following modifications to the **Frame Data Configuration** control.
        - Set the **horizontal resolution** control value to <font face = "courier new">2880</font>.
        - Set the **vertical resolution** control value to <font face = "courier new">1280</font>.
    
    > The Create TDMS Files utility settings are now similar to the image below.

    ![Create TDMS Files Settings for Multiple Images - SI1](../../images/PXIe-148X-CreateTDMS-GenMultipleImages.png)

4.  Run the VI to generate a TDMS file for channel SI1 containing 10 frames at 2880x1280 resolution.

### Generating and Displaying Multiple Images

> Note: This is a continuation from the previous section.

5. Set the following controls on the Generation Example GSE VI and leave all other values at their defaults.
    > Note: VI controls and indicators can be reset to default values by clicking on the **Edit** menu and selecting the **Reinitialize Values to Default** option.

    | Tab | Control | Value |
    |---|---|---|
    | Resource | RIO Device | [System Specific] |
    | Resource | Bitfile Path | [Refer to Bitfile Path in the PXIe-148X Generation GSE Help](../../reference/gettingstartedexample/gse-gen-help.md#table-of-pxie-148x-generation-bitfiles) |

6. Select the **Serial Channel** tab and make the following modifications.
    - Select index <font face = "courier new">0</font> of the **Channel Configurations** array and make the following modifications.
        - Select **Grayscale** on the **Interpretation** control in the **RAW Display Parameters** cluster.
    - Select index <font face = "courier new">1</font> of the **Channel Configurations** array and make the following modifications.
        - Set the **Serial Channel** control value to <font face = "courier new">SO1</font>.
        - Select **Grayscale** on the **Interpretation** control in the **RAW Display Parameters** cluster.
   
    > The settings on the **Serial Channel** tab are now similar to the image below.
   
    ![Generating and Displaying Multiple Images Channel Configurations](../../images/PXIe-148X-Gen-MultipleImages-ChannelConfigurations.png)

7. Run the VI, wait for the **Waiting for Serializer Setup** indicator to illuminate, and click the **Serializer Setup Complete** control button to start the generation.
    > Once the generation completes, notice the **Number of Generated Packets** indicator array shows a value of <font face = "courier new">10820</font> at index 0 and <font face = "courier new">12820</font> at index 1, which equals the number of packets per frame (vertical resolution) times the number of frames generated for each channel. The indices in the **Number of Generated Packets** array correspond to the indices in the **Channel Configurations** array.

    ![Generating and Displaying Multiple Images Generated Packets Indicator](../../images/PXIe-148X-Gen-MultipleImages-GeneratedPacketsIndicator.png)

8. Click the **First Display Channel** tab to view the last frame displayed for SO0.
    > Note that the image resolution matches the 1920x1080 resolution of the TDMS file created for SI0.

    ![Generating and Displaying Multiple Images Second Display Channel](../../images/PXIe-148X-Gen-MultipleImages-SecondDisplayChannel.png)

### Setting a Start Trigger Delay

> Note: This is a continuation from the previous section.

This section of the tutorial shows you how to delay the generation start. Image data acquired using the PXIe-148X Acquisition getting started example often has several seconds of delay before the first packet is acquired while the camera is configured. The PXIe-148X Generation getting started example sets a packet timing offset value to the negative of the first packet timestamp in the TDMS file to prevent any unwanted delay in the start of generation. If a delay is desired the **Start Trigger Delay (s)** control is used. Refer to the **Start Trigger Delay (s)** description in the [PXIe-148X Generation GSE Help](../../reference/gettingstartedexample/gse-gen-help.md#serial-channel-tab) for additional details.

10. Select the **Serial Channel** tab and set the **Start Trigger Delay (s)** control value to <font face = "courier new">2</font>.
   
    > The settings on the **Serial Channel** tab are now similar to the image below.
    
    ![Generating and Displaying Multiple Images Start Trigger Delay](../../images/PXIe-148X-Gen-MultipleImages-StartTriggerDelay.png)

11. Run the VI, wait for the **Waiting for Serializer Setup** indicator to illuminate, and click the **Serializer Setup Complete** control button to start the generation. 
    > The start of packet transmission is delayed and thus the image display is also delayed. Notice that there is now a 2 second delay before images are generated and displayed after clicking the **Serializer Setup Complete** button. 

## Using the General Purpose Input/Output (GPIO) Lines

This tutorial shows you how to configure routing of GPIO lines between GPIO banks as well as manually reading and writing to the GPIO banks on the PXIe-148X interface module. This tutorial modifies GPIO line values while the generation is running, logs the GPIO timestamps to disk and displays digital waveforms of the GPIO lines.

> Note: Timestamps are relative to a time immediately after the FPGA bitfile is downloaded and run, not the start of the generation. This allows capturing I2C and GPIO timestamps during configuration before the generation starts.

1. Set the following controls on the Generation Example GSE VI and leave all other values at their defaults.
    > Note: VI controls and indicators can be reset to default values by clicking on the **Edit** menu and selecting the **Reinitialize Values to Default** option.

    | Tab | Setting | Value |
    |---|---|---|
    | Resource | RIO Device | [System Specific] |
    | Resource | Bitfile Path | [Refer to Bitfile Path in the PXIe-148X Generation GSE Help](../../reference/gettingstartedexample/gse-gen-help.md#table-of-pxie-148x-generation-bitfiles) |
    | Resource | Display Generated Images | Disabled |
    | Resource | Log GPIO to Disk | Enabled |

### Creating a TDMS File for the GPIO Tutorial

1. Open the Create CSI-2 Packet TDMS Files utility in the LabVIEW project.

2. Make the following modifications on the Create CSI-2 Packet TDMS Files utility front panel.
    - Set the **Number of Frames** control to <font face = "courier new">60</font>
    - Update the **Frame Data Configuration** cluster with the following settings.
        - Set the **horizontal resolution** control value to <font face = "courier new">640</font>.
        - Set the **vertical resolution** control value to <font face = "courier new">480</font>.
    - In the **Frame Timing Configuration** cluster, set the **desired frame rate (fps)** control to <font face = "courier new">1</font>.
    
    > The Create TDMS Files utility settings are now similar to the image below.

    ![Create TDMS Files Settings for the GPIO Turtorial](../../images/PXIe-148X-CreateTDMS-GenGPIO.png)

3. Run the VI to generate a TDMS file for channel SI0 containing 60 frames at 640x480 resolution.
    > The frame rate of 1 frame per second will cause the generation to run for 1 minute, which will allow enough time to manually read and write to GPIO during the generation.

### Manually Reading and Writing to GPIO

This tutorial shows you how to perform manual reads and writes to GPIO during generation and display digital waveforms for the resulting GPIO timestamp data.
> Note: The [Creating a TDMS File for the GPIO Tutorial](#creating-a-tdms-file-for-the-gpio-tutorial) section should be run prior to running the steps in this tutorial.

1. Select the **GPIO** tab and make the following modifications.
    - Update the **GPIO to Display** array with the following settings.
        - At index 0 select **Ser0 GPIO** in the **GPIO Bank** control and set the **GPIO Number** to <font face = "courier new">0</font>.

### Routing GPIO Lines

This tutorial shows you how to define GPIO line routes between GPIO banks on Serial Input/Output channel pairs. Routing GPIO lines means that the values read from the source GPIO lines are written to the destination GPIO lines on the FPGA. Manual GPIO writes performed from the host override the GPIO routes. 
> Notes: 
> - This tutorial only applies to interface modules with serial input _and_ serial output channels since GPIO routing is done between pairs of input and output channels.
> - The [Creating a TDMS File for the GPIO Tutorial](#creating-a-tdms-file-for-the-gpio-tutorial) section should be run prior to running the steps in this tutorial.
> - The focus of this tutorial is on configuring GPIO routes, not manually reading and writing to GPIO or displaying digital waveforms of GPIO timestamps. For more detailed descriptions of those topics, see [Manually Reading and Writing to GPIO](#manually-reading-and-writing-to-gpio).

1. Select the **GPIO** tab and make the following modifications.
    - Add a GPIO route at index 0 of the **GPIO Routes** array with the following settings.
        - Select **SI to SO** in the **Direction** control.
        - Set **Serial Channel** to <font face = "courier new">0</font>.
        - Select **GPIO 0** in the **Source** control.
        - Select **GPIO 3** in the **Destination** control.

    ![GPIO Routes - Index 0 Settings](../../images/PXIe-148X-Gen-RouteGPIO-Route0.png)

    - Add a GPIO route at index 1 of the **GPIO Routes** array with the following settings.
        - Select **SI to SO** in the **Direction** control.
        - Set **Serial Channel** to <font face = "courier new">0</font>.
        - Select **GPIO 1** in the **Source** control.
        - Select **GPIO 0** in the **Destination** control.

    ![GPIO Routes - Index 1 Settings](../../images/PXIe-148X-Gen-RouteGPIO-Route1.png)

    > These settings define the GPIO routes shown below.
    >
    > | From (Source) | To (Destination) |
    > |---|---|
    > | SI 0 Deserializer Line 0 | SO 0 Serializer Line 3|
    > | SI 0 Deserializer Line 1 | SO 0 Serializer Line 0 |

    - Update the **GPIO to Display** array with the following settings.
        - At index 0 select **Des0 GPIO** in the **GPIO Bank** control and set the **GPIO Number** to <font face = "courier new">0</font>. 
        - At index 1 select **Des0 GPIO** in the **GPIO Bank** control and set the **GPIO Number** to <font face = "courier new">1</font>.
        - At index 2 select **Ser0 GPIO** in the **GPIO Bank** control and set the **GPIO Number** to <font face = "courier new">0</font>. 
        - At index 3 select **Ser0 GPIO** in the **GPIO Bank** control and set the **GPIO Number** to <font face = "courier new">3</font>.

    - Select **SI 0 Deserializer** from the **GPIO Bank Select** drop down menu.

    - In the **GPIO Bank Output Enable** cluster, enable the **GPIO 0** and **GPIO 1** controls.

3. Run the VI, wait for the **Waiting for Serializer Setup** indicator to illuminate, and click the **Serializer Setup Complete** control button to start the generation.

4. Click **Update GPIO Output** to write false values to the lines 0 and 1 on the SI 0 Deserializer GPIO bank.

5. Set the **GPIO 0** button in the **GPIO Bank Output** control to <font face = "courier new">true</font> then click the **Update GPIO Output** button to write a true value to line 0 on the SI 0 Deserializer GPIO bank.

6. Set the **GPIO 1** button in the **GPIO Bank Output** control to <font face = "courier new">true</font> then click the **Update GPIO Output** button to write a true value to line 1 on the SI 0 Deserializer GPIO bank.

7. Set the **GPIO 0** and **GPIO 1** buttons in the **GPIO Bank Output** control to <font face = "courier new">false</font> then click the **Update GPIO Output** button to write a false values to lines 0 and 1 on the SI 0 Deserializer GPIO bank.

8. Click the **Stop Generation** button.

9. Once the VI stops running, click on the **GPIO Timestamps** tab to view a digital waveform of the selected GPIO lines.

    > GPIO timestamp data is displayed in the **GPIO Timestamps Waveform** digital waveform indicator. The waveforms observed are for the sources and the destinations of the defined GPIO routes. Notice that the values written to the source GPIO lines match the values read on the destination GPIO lines.
